# TensorFlow Fundamentals

This repository will help you to grow basic knowledge about [Google's TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## What is TensorFlow and it's fundamentals

> What

TensorFlow is an open source end-to-end machine learning library for preprocessing data, modelling data and serving models (getting them into hands of others)

> Why

Rather than building machine learning models from scratch and train which requires huge computation power, separate GPUs/TPUs, it's more likely you'll use a library such as TensorFlow. It contains many of the most common machine learning functions you'll want to use.

> Topics covered in this repository

* Introduction to tensors (How to create tensors)
* Getting information from tensors (tensor attributes/properties)
* Manipulating tensors (tensor operations)
* Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular Python functions)
* Using GPUs with TensorFlow
* Exercises to Try

> What is TPU & GPU ?

**TPU**, Tensor Processing Unit is an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit developed by Google for neural network machine learning, using Google's own TensorFlow software.

**GPU**, Graphical Processing Unit, usually we use it for our personal computers to enhance the graphical interface of our CPUs and support high end softwares which requires high graphics.
